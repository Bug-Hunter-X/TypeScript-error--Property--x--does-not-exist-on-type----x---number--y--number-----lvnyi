This repository contains a TypeScript code example demonstrating a common error: incorrectly defining an object type and then attempting to access a property that might not exist.  The `bug.ts` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.ts` presents the solution.  The issue arises from using the `?` optional property syntax in the object type definition without fully accounting for its implications when accessing properties.
